# Situational Instructions Database (SID)

Official repository of the Situational Instructions Database (SID) project.

## Dataset Details

Situational Instructions Database (SID) is a dataset for dynamic task guidance. It contains situationally-aware
instructions for performing a wide range of everyday tasks or completing scenarios in 3D environments. The dataset
provides step-by-step instructions for these scenarios which are grounded in the context of the situation. This
context is defined through a scenario-specific scene graph that captures the objects, their attributes, and their
relations in the environment. The dataset is designed to enable research in the areas of grounded language learning,
instruction following, and situated dialogue.

For complete documentation, please see the [dataset card](DATASET_CARD.md).
