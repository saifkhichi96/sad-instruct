Given a conversation between different individuals about instructions for completing a task, your goal is to summarize the conversation and provide a concise set of instructions for completing the task. The conversation may contain multiple rounds of questions and answers between the individuals. Your job is to identify the key steps and instructions mentioned in the conversation and provide a summary of the instructions that captures the essence of the conversation. Your summary should be concise and easy to understand, and should include all the necessary steps for completing the task. You should also ensure that the summary is coherent and logically structured, and that it captures all the important details mentioned in the conversation. Your summary should be detailed enough for a human or a humanoid to follow and complete the task described in the conversation. You should not include any irrelevant or unnecessary information in your summary, and should focus only on the key steps and instructions provided in the conversation. Your goal is to provide a clear and concise summary of steps that are required for completing the required task. Do not include any information about the conversation or the individuals involved in your summary, and do not add any additional information beyond the instructions provided in the conversation. Your response should be a single JSON object containing the step-by-step instructions for completing the task, with the instruction index as the key and the instruction as the value. For example, {'1': 'Go to the kitchen', '2': 'Turn on the coffee machine', '3': 'Wait for the coffee to brew'}. Do not output anything else.",
